<div class="StoryPara">
	<span class="blackdc">M</span>onday dawned warm and rainless. Aurelio Escovar, a dentist without a
degree, and a very early riser, opened his office at six. He took some
false teeth, still mounted in their plaster mold, out of the glass case
and put on the table a fistful of instruments which he arranged in size
order, as if they were on display. He wore a collarless striped shirt,
closed at the neck with a golden stud, and pants held up by suspenders
He was erect and skinny, with a look that rarely corresponded to the
situation, the way deaf people have of looking.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
When he had things arranged on the table, he pulled the drill toward
the dental chair and sat down to polish the false teeth. He seemed not
to be thinking about what he was doing, but worked steadily, pumping the
drill with his feet, even when he didn't need it.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
After eight he stopped for a while to look at the sky through the
window, and he saw two pensive buzzards who were drying themselves in
the sun on the ridgepole of the house next door. He went on working with
the idea that before lunch it would rain again. The shrill voice of his
elevenyear-old son interrupted his concentration.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"Papa."</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"What?"</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"The Mayor wants to know if you'll pull his tooth."</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"Tell him I'm not here."</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
He was polishing a gold tooth. He held it at arm's length, and
examined it with his eyes half closed. His son shouted again from the
little waiting room.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"He says you are, too, because he can hear you."</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
The dentist kept examining the tooth. Only when he had put it on the
table with the finished work did he say:</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"So much the better."</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
He operated the drill again. He took several pieces of a bridge out
of a cardboard box where he kept the things he still had to do and began
to polish the gold.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"Papa."</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"What?"</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
He still hadn't changed his expression.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"He says if you don't take out his tooth, he'll shoot you."</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
Without hurrying, with an extremely tranquil movement, he stopped
pedaling the drill, pushed it away from the chair, and pulled the lower
drawer of the table all the way out. There was a revolver. "O.K.," he
said. "Tell him to come and shoot me."</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
He rolled the chair over opposite the door, his hand resting on the
edge of the drawer. The Mayor appeared at the door. He had shaved the
left side of his face, but the other side, swollen and in pain, had a
five-day-old beard. The dentist saw many nights of desperation in his
dull eyes. He closed the drawer with his fingertips and said softly:</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"Sit down."</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"Good morning," said the Mayor.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"Morning," said the dentist.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
While the instruments were boiling, the Mayor leaned his skull on the
headrest of the chair and felt better. His breath was icy. It was a poor
office: an old wooden chair, the pedal drill, a glass case with ceramic
bottles. Opposite the chair was a window with a shoulder-high cloth
curtain. When he felt the dentist approach, the Mayor braced his heels
and opened his mouth.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
Aurelio Escovar turned his head toward the light. After inspecting
the infected tooth, he closed the Mayor's jaw with a cautious pressure
of his fingers.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"It has to be without anesthesia," he said.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"Why?"</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"Because you have an abscess."</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
The Mayor looked him in the eye. "All right," he said, and tried to
smile. The dentist did not return the smile. He brought the basin of
sterilized instruments to the worktable and took them out of the water
with a pair of cold tweezers, still without hurrying. Then he pushed the
spittoon with the tip of his shoe, and went to wash his hands in the
washbasin. He did all this without looking at the Mayor. But the Mayor
didn't take his eyes off him.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
It was a lower wisdom tooth. The dentist spread his feet and grasped
the tooth with the hot forceps. The Mayor seized the arms of the chair,
braced his feet with all his strength, and felt an icy void in his
kidneys, but didn't make a sound. The dentist moved only his wrist.
Without rancor, rather with a bitter tenderness, he said:</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"Now you'll pay for our twenty dead men."</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
The Mayor felt the crunch of bones in his jaw, and his eyes filled
with tears. But he didn't breathe until he felt the tooth come out. Then
he saw it through his tears. It seemed so foreign to his pain that he
failed to understand his torture of the five previous nights.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
Bent over the spittoon, sweating, panting, he unbuttoned his tunic
and reached for the handkerchief in his pants pocket. The dentist gave
him a clean cloth.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"Dry your tears," he said.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
The Mayor did. He was trembling. While the dentist washed his
hands, he saw the crumbling ceiling and a dusty spider web with spider's
eggs and dead insects. The dentist returned, drying his hands. "Go to
bed," he said, "and gargle with salt water." The Mayor stood up, said
goodbye with a casual military salute, and walked toward the door,
stretching his legs, without buttoning up his tunic.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"Send the bill," he said.</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"To you or the town?"</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
The Mayor didn't look at him. He closed the door and said through
the screen:</div>
<div class="StoryPara">
"It's the same damn thing."</div>
